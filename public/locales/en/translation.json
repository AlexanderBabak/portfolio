    "text1": "In 2008 I wrote my first Hello World! I was the head of the press service of the FC 'Sheriff Tiraspol' (the same one that beat in 2021 'Real Madrid' at the Santiago Bernabeu).  I was also responsible for the work of the club website. There I first tried myself as a developer and content manager. In 2018, when the need for IT specialists began to grow, and training became very high, I had the idea to become a front-end developer. The decision was spontaneous. I was 31 at the time and had been a journalist for 12 years. Television, radio, writing press. You can, in my profession I experience everything. And I took on a new challenge.",

There is only one conclusion - if you want to become a programmer, you will become one. Whether it is difficult, everyone decides for himself."
